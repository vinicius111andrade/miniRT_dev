031 - FATAL - Ambient light RGB argument has wrong number of values.
032 - FATAL - Ambient light has a negative RGB number.
033 - FATAL - Ambient light has an out of bounds RGB number. Must be 0 <= n <= 255.
034 - FATAL - Ambient light brightness is not a proper ratio. Must be 0 <= n <= 1.

035 - FATAL - Camera has the wrong number of arguments.
036 - FATAL - Camera has weird FOV value.
037 - FATAL - Camera coordinate with wrong number of values. Must be 3, xyz.
038 - FATAL - Camera coordinate with weird value.
039 - FATAL - Camera direction vector has at least one value outside the interval [-1,1].
040 - FATAL - Camera FOV is out of bounds, it must be between 0 and 180.

048 - FATAL - Light has an out of bounds RGB number. Must be 0 <= n <= 255.
049 - FATAL - Light brightness is not a proper ratio. Must be 0 <= n <= 1.

050 - FATAL - Plane has the wrong number of arguments.
051 - FATAL - Plane ratio is not well formatted.
052 - FATAL - Plane has a weird RGB number.
053 - FATAL - Plane RGB argument has wrong number of values.
054 - FATAL - Plane has a negative RGB number.
055 - FATAL - Plane coordinate with wrong number of values. Must be 3, xyz.
056 - FATAL - Plane coordinate with weird value.
057 - FATAL - Plane normal vector has at least one value outside the interval [-1,1].
058 - FATAL - Plane has an out of bounds RGB number. Must be 0 <= n <= 255.
059 - FATAL - Plane brightness is not a proper ratio. Must be 0 <= n <= 1.
